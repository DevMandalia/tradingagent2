In this video, we take a deep dive into the create_order function of the CCXT library in Python, providing a step-by-step guide to place cryptocurrency orders with precision. We start with a brief overview of the CCXT library's strengths for crypto trading and guide you through setting up your API keys for secure exchange communication. As we delve further, we meticulously explore the intricacies of the create_order function, demonstrating its use in Spot Market and Limit Orders. We then transition to Futures Orders, and cover setting up the leverage. Wrapping up, we touch upon exchange-specific requirements and the best practices to ensure smooth trading experiences.

We demonstrate how to place some market orders in Python with the ''meta-API'' ccxt Python library. This pedagogical tutorial guides you through the steps of using market order functions, creating an API key on the KuCoin exchange and linking it with the market order code. We also show how to use ccxt to download OHLCV data and do candle plot with the mplfinance Python library.
