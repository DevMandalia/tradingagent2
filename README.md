Place MARKET ORDERS in Python with the CCXT library and KuCoin | Tutorial

https://youtu.be/qgBzo-EUYIw

We demonstrate how to place some market orders in Python with the ''meta-API'' ccxt Python library. This pedagogical tutorial guides you through the steps of using market order functions, creating an API key on the KuCoin exchange and linking it with the market order code. We also show how to use ccxt to download OHLCV data and do candle plot with the mplfinance Python library.
